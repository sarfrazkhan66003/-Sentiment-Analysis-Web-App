# -Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App

Predict Emotions from Voice and Text Using AI & Machine Learning

🚀 About the Project
  This is an AI-powered web application that performs Sentiment Analysis on user input — either through text or voice. The model classifies the emotion into:
  ✅ Positive
  ❌ Negative
  ⚪ Neutral

The app uses:
  🎙️ Speech Recognition for converting voice to text
  💬 TF-IDF Vectorization
  🤖 Machine Learning model (trained offline)
  📊 Probability Chart for confidence visualization

📸 App Preview
  ✅ Try out voice input or manually type any sentence and get instant sentiment feedback along with model confidence.
  🧠 Features
  🎤 Voice input using Google Speech Recognition
  📝 Text-based sentiment prediction
  📊 Probability graph using Matplotlib
  📜 Live prediction history
  💡 Clean, responsive Streamlit interface
